CMECS is a comprehensive national framework for organizing information about coasts and oceans and their living systems.

In Oregon there are multiple groups applying CMECS in their work. As yet there only a few cross-project coordination efforts, but over time this may improve. It has been suggested that eventually CMECS may become a recognized Oregon Framework data element.

As we become aware of active projects we will list them here for maximum visibility. To have an Oregon CMECS project listed please email the information to tanya.haddad@state.or.us.

##Help build CMECS!

We will be using this repo to track issues with the first generation CMECS product produced in Phase I, so that improvements can be integrated in Phase II.
