CMECS is a comprehensive national framework for organizing information about coasts and oceans and their living systems.

In Oregon there are multiple groups applying CMECS in their work. As yet there only a few cross-project coordination efforts, but over time this may improve. It has been agreed that CMECS will become a recognized Oregon Framework data element.

As we become aware of active projects we will list them here for maximum visibility. To have an Oregon CMECS project listed please email the information to tanya.haddad@state.or.us (or send a pull request).
